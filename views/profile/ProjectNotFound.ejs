<h1>ðŸš€ Heads Up!</h1>
<p>Most of my projects are hosted using GitHub Pages, which only supports front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That means projects built with React or Node.js wonâ€™t run live here â€” but donâ€™t worry! ðŸ’¡
  You can still explore the full source code on my GitHub to see how everything works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Stay curious and keep building! ðŸ”§âœ¨</p>
