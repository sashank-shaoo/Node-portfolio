  <p>👨‍💻 <strong>Developer Profile:</strong> Sashank Sahoo</p>
  <section class="summary">
    <h2>🌟 Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer, specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). My journey in web development started with a curiosity to understand how websites work—and that curiosity quickly turned into a full-fledged career path.</p>
    <p>With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have built multiple responsive, user-friendly, and interactive web interfaces. I further enhanced my front-end capabilities by learning Tailwind CSS to streamline styling and create clean, modern UI designs with utility-first principles.</p>
    <p>On the back-end, my expertise lies in creating secure, scalable, and RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, while efficiently handling data with MongoDB and Mongoose. I’ve also worked with SQL databases, which gives me a flexible understanding of both relational and non-relational data structures.</p>
    <p>I have hands-on experience with version control systems like Git, and I actively use GitHub to collaborate, maintain, and showcase my projects. Whether it’s building a complete web app from scratch, debugging complex issues, or deploying applications, I approach every challenge with a mindset of continuous learning and growth.</p>
